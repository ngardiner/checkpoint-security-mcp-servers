# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:
# This file contains sensitive information (API Key).
# In a real-world deployment, NEVER store secrets directly in code like this.
# Use secure methods like environment variables, secret management systems (e.g.,
# AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault), or secure configuration files
# with restricted access.
# For this development and testing phase, storing it here is acceptable *only*
# within a controlled, isolated lab environment and with appropriate file permissions.
